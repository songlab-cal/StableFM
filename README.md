# Stability and Fine-Mapping

This repository contains data and scripts for the following paper:

> Aw, A.J., Jin, L.C., Ioannidis, N.M., and Song, Y.S. (2023+) "The impact of stability considerations on genetic fine-mapping"

## Fine-mapping results

Results are stored under `/data/results_with_moderators`.

## Summary data files

Summary files containing the 378 functional annotations associated with each fine-mapped variant (stable or top) are stored under `/data/all_func_annots`. We recommend directly working with these files to reproduce our findings and figures.

## Generating Figures in Paper

Code for generating figures is stored under `/scripts`.
