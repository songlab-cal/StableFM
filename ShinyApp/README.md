# Shiny App

This app was developed by Alan Aw and Lionel Jin as part of the paper, "The Impact of Stability Considerations on Genetic Fine-Mapping." 

## Deployment and Usage Requirements 

To load the app on a local machine or server, you will require:

- [RStudio](https://posit.co/downloads/)

- The followinng R packages: `shiny`, `shinythemes`, `shinyjs` `dplyr`, `ggplot2`, `readr` and `data.table` (install in R using `install.packages(...)`)

To deploy on a local machine for individual use, download this directory and run `app.R`. Server deployment may be available depending on services provided by your organization (e.g., UC Berkeley's Statistical Computing Facility provides such an [app hosting service](https://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing/faqs/hosting-shiny-app)).
